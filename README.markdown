CL-LLVM provides Common Lisp bindings to the [LLVM-C API](http://llvm.org/doxygen/dir_ba5bdc16f452288d1429bb9e178a5965.html)  bindings for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). 

There is an improved version of [the LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) in `tutorial/`, written in Common Lisp. 
Notably, it has no lexer or parser, instead using s-expressions.
To run:
   (ql:quickload :kaleidoscope256)
   (k-shared::test-all)

c-bindings.lisp contains semi-automatically generated bindings for LLVM 6.0, generated by a modified version of the vacietis parser, using the header files for the c-api, found in {LLVM-SRC-ROOT}/src/include/llvm-c/, then manually smoothed out after.

Conversion from C to Lisp names for C functions:
    The "LLVM" prefix is dropped.
    Each capital letter is replaced by the lowercase letter prefixed by a hyphen. 
    Example: 
        LLVMInitializeNativeTarget -> -initialize-native-target

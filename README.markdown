CL-LLVM provides Common Lisp bindings to the [LLVM-C API](http://llvm.org/doxygen/dir_ba5bdc16f452288d1429bb9e178a5965.html)  bindings for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). 

To load the bindings:

`(ql:quickload :llvm256)`

There is an improved version of [the LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) in `tutorial/`, written in Common Lisp. 
Notably, it has no lexer or parser, instead using s-expressions.

Requires [the kaleidoscope jit wth glue code](https://github.com/terminal625/llvm-builds).

To run the kaleidoscope tutorial:

`(ql:quickload :kaleidoscope256)` 

`(k-shared::test-all)`

Conversion from C to Lisp names for C functions:
- The "LLVM" prefix is dropped.
- Each capital letter is replaced by the lowercase letter prefixed by a hyphen. 
- Example: `LLVMInitializeNativeTarget` -> `-initialize-native-target`
   
"c-bindings.lisp" contains semi-automatically generated bindings for LLVM 6.0, generated by a modified version of the vacietis parser, using the header files for the c-api, found in {LLVM-SRC-ROOT}/src/include/llvm-c/, then manually smoothed out after.

CL-LLVM provides Common Lisp bindings to the [LLVM-C API](http://llvm.org/doxygen/dir_ba5bdc16f452288d1429bb9e178a5965.html)  bindings for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). 

There is an improved version of [the LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) in `tutorial/`, written in Common Lisp.

c-bindings.lisp contains semi-automatically generated bindings.
- generated by a modified version of the vacietis parser
- manually smoothed out after
